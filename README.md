# Parcel-Typescript-MobX-GraphQL

This is a boilerplate with the above tech set up and ready to go.

### Full list

- Parcel
- Typescript
- MobX
- Apollo GraphQL
- ts-lint
- Prettier
- Pathricia router
- Styled-components
- Lodash

+ Some helpers for Apollo that I often use.

Ts-lint and Prettier are set up to work together.

Apollo is set up to talk to http://localhost:4000 which is where Apollo-server will be by default.
Change this in `src/helpers/graphqlClient.ts`.

### TODO

- env
- lintstaged
- testing (will be using Jest)

### Run it

To run the development server:

`yarn start`

To build for production:

`yarn run build`
